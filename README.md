# Express Scaffolding Cli

## How to install this ?

- npm i express-scaffolding-cli
- you can also install globally by typing this command i.e. npm i -g express-scaffolding-cli

## How to run this ?

- I'll prefer install this package globally and then simply type this command i.e. express-scaffolding-cli
- You can also use npx this is your choice.

## How to use this ?

- This is a very simple cli. First it will ask you a project name that you want to create.
- If you are already in the folder that you want to scaffold then simply add . which means scaffolding in the current folder.
- But if you want to create folder and then scaffold in that folder then you'll have to pass the folder name just a regular string this cli will automatically create a folder for you and all that scaffolding stuff. Happy Coding üòä‚ù§Ô∏è .
